## Matlab-CreativeArt

While working with complex I/Q data from radio signals, some of graphic plots ended up being pieces of an art work by accident. So, it might be worth sharing it with you. Matlab is a powerful software that is used in various fields such as engineering, mathematics, economics, automation systems. It has a rich set of libraries for signal processing and data visualization. Though Matlabâ€™s graphics engine is not meant for high quality artwork, it is fun to play with it. 

Here are sample outputs.

  <img src="images/MatlabArt3.png" alt="" width="256" height="auto"/>
  <img src="images/MatlabArt4.png" alt="" width="256" height="auto"/>

If you are serious artist, however, I recommend you to check other softwares such as [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/) which are platforms for professional creative artwork design.
